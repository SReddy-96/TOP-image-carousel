# Image Carousel

## Objective
Using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript build responsive image carousel.
### Key Points:
- Arrow either side to navigate through the images.
- Bubbles at the bottom of the carousel to show where you are in the order of image.
- The bubbles, if clicked, take the user to the desired image.
- It will also run on a 5second timer and syphon through the image one at a time in order.
- Minimal hard coding of measurements, so its easy to add more or less images to the carousel.
